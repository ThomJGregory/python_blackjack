# python_blackjack

### In the future I would like to add a few things. I would like to keep track of how many hands the user has won, fix the ace-scoring(the aces are either all-high or all-low), and implement a GUI

### After the GUI, I would like to add the more complicated aspects of the game and betting. These both seem difficult without a good user interface.
